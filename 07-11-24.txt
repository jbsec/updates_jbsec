I'm writing this to anyone looking at my Github.

At the moment my time is split between:

1. PhD work (reading, writing, coding, etc)
2. Teaching (supervising, lab supprort marking)
3. Exercise 
4. Everyday chores
5. Chess
6. Learning languages
7. Working on new projects
8. Leetcode problems
9. Trying to have a social life ðŸ˜¹

Therefore it's looking a little less green on my squares.

I am here! Active! but just not able to contribute stuff or work on uploads.

THNX all.
